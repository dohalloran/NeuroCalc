			<h1>About NeuroCalc</h1>
			<p>The Nernst equation has a physiological application when used to calculate the potential of an ion of charge <i>z</i> across a membrane. This potential is determined using the concentration of the ion both inside and outside the cell</p>
			<p>The Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz voltage equation, more commonly known as the Goldman equation, is used in cell membrane physiology to determine the reversal potential across a cell's membrane, taking into account all of the ions that are permeant through that membrane</p>

			<p>NeuroCalc was developed by ohalloranlab for Android and ios devices in 2018, and serves as a user friendly app that aims to help students calculate the Nernst reversal potential and Goldman Hodgkin Katz equation.</p>
